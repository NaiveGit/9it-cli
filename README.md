## 9it

Totally not git! 9it is actually what we like to call a 'single-player' version control system. It has most of the basic functionality of git minus pushing and pulling. Thus, it is lightweight and intended for individual use.

### USAGE
Please read the man page or pass in the help flag for usage.

### INSTALLATION
Simply clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/NaiveGit/9it-cli
```
And install using make:
```
make && sudo make clean install
```
The binary is installed to /usr/local in addition to man pages at /usr/local/man.

### FEATURES
## Security
Your data is secured with military grade encryption using an advanced and cutting edge cryptographic hash algorithm known as 'the Caesar Cipher'. The key is randomly generated and stored in plain text, guarenteeing infeasible brute forcing.
